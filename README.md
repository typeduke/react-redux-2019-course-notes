# react-redux-2019-course-notes

**Notes on and source code from the Udemy course "Modern React with Redux" (2019 edition) by Stephen Grider**

:point_right: This repository represents the 2019 edition of the course, of which I completed only some projects.
I completed the course's 2017 edition entirely, within [this repository](https://github.com/lambdarookie/react-redux-2017-course-notes).

  This repository only represents a fraction of what is to be found within the course.
  Also, this repository contains many additions and comments that are not part of the course.
